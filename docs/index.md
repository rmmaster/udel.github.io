## Milestone 1:

### **Installations:**
- [Installation of Visual Studio Code, and TypeScript working in it.](/VSCInstall.md)

### **GitHub Pages / Portfolio Setup:**
- To format this page and learn how to create a GitHub page, I used GitHub's Markdown and Pages tutorials

### **HTML, CSS and JavaScript:**
9/8/2021:

- I created a website using knowledge from the MarkSheet descriptions and examples

- I also looked at Mozilla's HTML guide for further information and guidance

- [Link to first website](/websites/Spectacled.html)

## Milestone 2:
I have been very busy this week, so I haven't had much time to work on the portfolio besides Tuesday and Thursday. Mostly Thursday.

Sorry for the lesser amount of progress. I will catch up over the weekend.

8:50 9/16:

I'd do some more but I'm feeling very sad right now. I promise I'll catch up over the weekend. Not trying to bargain for a better score, just saying why I haven't done that much.

- I made some changes to that [first website](/websites/Spectacled.html) of mine, notably adding CSS to it in addition to the HTML already present. 
- To be more precise, I changed the font colors and font family, the background to be a dark gradient, and centered the website.
- I did some experimentation on what I knew in HTML and CSS and created the image that appears if you hover over the anchor that says "my profile picture on Steam"
- I got the embedded YouTube video working after remembering YouTube has a button to press to get the embedding code automatically. I was trying to embed the video like an actual video file, not as an online video, that's why it was not working.

## Milestone 3:
9/19/2021

- I followed along Mozilla's beginning basics to JavaScript tutorial to get familiarized with some simple JavaScript.
- [The tutorial in question](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)
- [Link to the testing website](/websites/MozillaTutorial/index.html)
- I plan on doing some more tutorials and doing experimenting on my own!
