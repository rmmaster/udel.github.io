9/8/2021:

- I created a website using knowledge from the MarkSheet descriptions and examples

- I also looked at Mozilla's HTML guide for further information and guidance

## Milestone 2:
I have been very busy this week, so I haven't had much time to work on the portfolio besides Tuesday and Thursday. Mostly Thursday.

Sorry for the lesser amount of progress.
