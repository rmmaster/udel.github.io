                The <strong>spectacled flying fox</strong> (pteropus conspicillatus) 
                is notable for its fur pattern of black and light brown, especially 
                on how the light brown fur wraps around its eyes to give it a 
                look as if it were wearing glasses.

                I <em>love</em> all flying foxes, but these have always struck me as the cutest.

                has been a pair of two cute spectacled flying foxes. They have been my favorite animal 
                for a long time. I would love to hold and pet one at some point in my life.
